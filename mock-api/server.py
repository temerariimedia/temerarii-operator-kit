"""A stand-in for the real distribution API.

    python mock-api/server.py            # listens on 127.0.0.1:8787

It accepts POST /publish, validates the payload the way the real service would, and
returns 200 with an id or 4xx with a reason. Accepted payloads are appended to
mock-api/received.jsonl so you can inspect exactly what you sent.

There are no credentials anywhere in this kit, and this is why: you can learn and prove
the entire publish path — payload shape, traceability, per-channel limits, error
handling — without a single live key. Nobody working through these exercises should ever
hold a production credential, and nothing here requires one.
