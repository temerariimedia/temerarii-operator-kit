# Operator Kit

A working, self-contained slice of a real content-operations engine. Two brands, one
pipeline, no credentials.

You will use it to prove you can run the machine: read a calendar, understand what the
gates enforce, find what is wrong, fix it, and produce output that traces back to its
source. Everything is scored by a grader you can run yourself, as many times as you like,
before you submit anything.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your fork>
cd temerarii-operator-kit
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m pipeline.gates                          # gates for the default brand
BRAND=northgate-home python -m pipeline.gates     # ...and for the other one
python training/grade.py                          # your scorecard
```

Python 3.11+. The only dependency is PyYAML. If `python training/grade.py` prints a
scorecard, you are set up correctly.

On a fresh clone the scorecard reads **5/6**. That is expected — exercise 5 needs an
answer from you.

## The one idea

**A brand is a data package, not a special case in the code.**

Everything in `pipeline/` takes a brand and reads from `brands/<name>/`. Nothing is
hardcoded to either brand. That is what lets one engine run two businesses, and it is the
thing this kit is really testing.

The two brands are unalike on purpose:

| | `temerarii-media` | `northgate-home` |
|---|---|---|
| Market | B2B, national | B2C, one metro |
| Fiscal year opens | January | **March** |
| Voice bans | **hype** — "revolutionary", "game-changer" | **fear-selling** — "act now", "silent killer" |
| Channels | the shared calendar | shared calendar **+ a podcast**, and Nextdoor as **manual** |

### Why this is harder than it looks

The obvious version of "support multiple brands" is a config file with a name and a colour
in it. That is not what is happening here. Look at what actually varies:

**The fiscal year opens in a different month.** Not a display preference — every date in
the system derives from a brand's anchor. Week 27 is a July week for one brand and a
September week for the other. Any code that hardcodes a January anchor produces dates that
are *plausible* and wrong, which is the hardest kind of wrong to notice.

**The voice rules are inverted.** This is the important one, so read the row again. The
rules are not stricter on one side and looser on the other. `temerarii-media` bans **hype**;
`northgate-home` bans **fear and pressure**. Copy that is perfectly safe for one is a
violation for the other, and vice versa. There is no ordering, no superset, no "strict mode"
you could implement once and reuse.

**Channels are shared but extensible.** Every brand runs the same base calendar — all
social, long form, and owned (blog, email, SMS). `northgate-home` adds a podcast. It did not
require a pipeline change, and that is the test: a brand should be able to add a destination
by editing its own package.

**Not every channel has an API.** `northgate-home` lists Nextdoor as `manual` — a real
channel where the audience genuinely is, with no automated publishing. The pipeline still
builds and validates those payloads, then marks them for a human. Dropping them would be
easier and much worse: a channel that silently falls off the plan is not noticed for a month.

### The failure this design prevents

Suppose one function reaches for a default instead of taking the brand it was given —
a module-level cache, a hardcoded path, a `brand or DEFAULT_BRAND` that swallows an empty
string. You will not get an exception. You will get:

- A **voice gate that reports PASS** on copy containing violations, because it checked the
  other brand's word list.
- **Dates that look right** and are two months off.
- **Payloads for channels the brand does not run**, accepted and never delivered.

Every one of those is worse than a crash. A crash stops the line and gets fixed in an hour.
A silently wrong gate manufactures confidence — it tells you the work was checked when it
was not, and you find out weeks later from someone outside the company.

That is why `pipeline/brand.py` is the first file to read, why `brand_json()` is cached
**per brand**, and why every public function in this kit takes `brand` as an argument even
when it feels like boilerplate. Exercise 3 walks you into the exact bug. It is not
hypothetical — it shipped in the system this kit is modelled on, and it was found only
because someone ran a second brand through it and noticed the planted violations were not
firing.

**The general form, worth carrying past this kit:** when a system serves N things, the
dangerous bug is never the one that breaks all N. It is the one that works perfectly for
whichever thing you happened to test with.

Both brands are fictional or public content. Nothing here is confidential.

## Layout

```
brands/
  temerarii-media/     one authored week (W27)
  northgate-home/      two authored weeks (W10-11) + three planted voice violations
pipeline/
  brand.py             brand resolution — where every brand lookup starts
  schedule.py          4-4-5 fiscal calendar; weeks past 52 roll into next year
  calendar.py          load authored cells
  voice.py             the voice gate
  gates.py             every rule the system will not let you break
  publish.py           build + validate publish payloads
  utm.py               attributable links
mock-api/server.py     stands in for the real distribution API
training/grade.py      the grader
```

## Commands

```bash
python -m pipeline.gates --brand northgate-home        # all gates
python -m pipeline.gates --gate voice                  # one gate
python -m pipeline.voice --brand northgate-home        # violations, with context
python -m pipeline.publish --week 10 --brand northgate-home --dry-run
python mock-api/server.py                              # then --post instead of --dry-run
python training/grade.py                               # scorecard
python training/grade.py --exercise 4                  # one exercise
```

## No credentials, ever

There are no API keys in this kit and there is no way to add one usefully. The publish
path runs against a local mock that validates payloads exactly as the real service would
and refuses the same things.

This is not a limitation of the exercise, it is how the real work is set up: nobody holds
production credentials to learn on, and no piece of work reaches an audience without a
sign-off from someone accountable for the brand. You can learn and demonstrate the entire
pipeline without ever being able to break anything.

If any instruction ever asks you to put a real key in this repo, that instruction is wrong.
