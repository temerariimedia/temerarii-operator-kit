"""Which authored field feeds which channel.

A studio does not write one sentence and blast it everywhere. It writes NATIVE copy per
surface: a 280-character post is not an email subject, an email is not a podcast
description, and a 9:16 short is not a ten-minute YouTube outline. This module is the map
between what a Creative Lead authors and what each channel actually publishes.

    CHANNEL          <- AUTHORED FIELD
    x, linkedin, ... <- days.<Day>.social[n]      native short-form posts
    youtube          <- days.<Day>.short          9:16 vertical script/caption
    youtube_longform <- days.<Day>.longform       long-form title + outline
    podcast          <- days.<Day>.podcast        episode title + description
    blog             <- weeks.<n>.blog            the week's article
    email            <- days.<Day>.email_subject + email_body
    sms              <- days.<Day>.sms            <=160 chars, hard limit
    nextdoor         <- days.<Day>.social[0]      manual delivery, still authored

WHY THERE IS NO SILENT FALLBACK
An earlier version used the week's tagline as the body for EVERY channel. Everything
"worked" — payloads built, validation passed, the mock accepted them — and the output was
fifteen identical posts. Nothing failed, so nothing got fixed.

`resolve()` returns None when a channel has no authored content, and the completeness gate
turns that into a visible failure. An unauthored channel should be loud, because the
alternative is shipping filler under a client's name.
