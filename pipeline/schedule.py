"""The 4-4-5 fiscal retail calendar.

Weeks are numbered 1..52 and always start on a Sunday. Quarters are 13 weeks in a
4-4-5 month pattern. The `anchor` in a brand's GOAL.yaml is the Sunday of week 1, so
two brands can run entirely different fiscal years — northgate-home starts in March,
temerarii-media in January — without a single branch in the code.

WEEKS PAST 52 ARE REAL. A campaign placed near the end of a year runs into the next
one, and week 53 is 2027-W01, not "week 53". Code that clamps at 52 does not raise an
error — it silently produces a campaign with NO weeks, and the content sits on disk
unshipped. That happened in the system this kit is modelled on; `place()` below is
written the way it is because of it.
