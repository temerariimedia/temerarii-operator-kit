"""The gates — every rule the system will not let you break.

Exit 0 = every gate passed. Exit 1 = at least one failed, and the output names which.

THE DISCIPLINE THIS ENCODES: every bug becomes a permanent gate. When something breaks
in a way a person had to notice, you have learned that people do not reliably notice it.
The fix is not to be more careful next time — it is to write the check that fails loudly
the next time, forever, and to do it in the same change as the fix.

Each gate below exists because the corresponding mistake actually happened.
