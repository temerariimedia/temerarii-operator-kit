"""Build publish payloads from authored cells, and (optionally) post them to the mock API.

    python -m pipeline.publish --week 27 --dry-run
    python -m pipeline.publish --brand northgate-home --week 12 --post

THE RULE THIS ENFORCES: every published item traces back to a registry entry. A payload
with no `source` is refused here, before it ever reaches a network call. "Where did this
post come from?" must have an answer six months later, and the only reliable way to get
one is to make an unattributable payload impossible to construct.

Channels are per-brand and are NOT the same set. temerarii-media runs nine social
channels; northgate-home is a local trade business and runs Google Business Profile,
local SEO, Nextdoor, email and SMS — it has no business on X or Bluesky. Hardcoding a
channel list is the same class of bug as hardcoding a banned-word list.
