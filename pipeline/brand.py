"""Brand resolution — the one place that knows where a brand's data lives.

THE CENTRAL IDEA OF THIS KIT: the engine is brand-AGNOSTIC. A brand is a DATA PACKAGE,
not a special case in the code. Everything downstream — calendars, gates, renders,
publishing — takes a brand argument and reads from `brands/<name>/`.

If you only learn one thing here, learn this: any function that needs brand-specific
information must TAKE THE BRAND AS AN ARGUMENT. The moment a function reaches for a
default instead, it works perfectly for the first brand and silently serves the wrong
data to the second. That failure is invisible in testing with one brand, and it is the
single most common bug in systems like this one.

    BRAND=northgate-home python -m pipeline.voice --week 12

Exercise 4 in CURRICULUM.md is a real instance of that bug. It is not hypothetical — it
shipped in the system this kit is modelled on, and the fix is the one described here.
